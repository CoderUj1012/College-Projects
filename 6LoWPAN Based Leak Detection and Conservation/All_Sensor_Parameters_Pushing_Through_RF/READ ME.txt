To compile Transmitter code and program the C-Mote:
make TEST=tx		//for compiling
sudo make flash		//for programming

To compile Reciver code:
make TEST=rx		//for compiling
sudo make flash		//for programming

NOTE: Before programming C-Mote make sure that serial port name is correct. To know the serial port name, run motelist command in terminal and change content of DEV accordingly in Makefile.

After programming both Transmitter and Receiver, open serial port of receiver C-Mote with baudrate 4800.
